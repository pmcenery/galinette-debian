Basic Installation
==================

        Galinette uses the cmake build system. The simple instructions for
building Galinette are these commands:

                        mkdir ../galinette-build && cd ../galinette-build
                        cmake ../galinette
                        make
                        make install

        This will not work unless necessary prerequisites are met. These are:

                        dbus-1
                        dbus-glib-1
                        libftdi
                        libglade-2.0
                        gtk+-2.0
                        hal

        Various components of Galinette listed above have other dependencies
as well. If these are not met when the 'cmake' command is run, those components
will not be built. The output of 'cmake' should make it clear what these
dependencies are and how to meet them.

        Arguments can be given to cmake similar to those given to a traditional
configure script, like the install prefix. See 'cmake --help-full' for more
information. For example, 'configure --prefix=/usr/lib' translates to
'cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/lib'.
